\chapter{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Main points:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Node Copying is up to two orders of magnitude faster than Rollback
    when it comes to accessing the head of a version --- regardless of usage
    scenario.

    \item Rollback is not significantly faster at insertions at the head of a
    list --- even in the sequential usage scenario. In fact, in the
    pseudo-random usage scenario, it gets increasingly slower per e.g.
    \textsc{insert} operation.

    \item When inserting at a random index in the list, however, Rollback is
    about half an order of magnitude faster than Node Copying at insertions in
    the sequential usage scenario. In the randomized scenario, it is less than
    half an order of magnitude faster.

    \item Accessing a random element from the list is still much faster with
    Node Copying than with Rollback.

  \end{itemize}

  \item Rollback without elimination of superfluous operations or reordering is
  X orders of magnitude slower than the optimized implementation. 

\end{itemize}
