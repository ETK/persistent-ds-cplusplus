\chapter{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Main points:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Node Copying is significantly faster at access, as expected.

    \item Rollback is faster at changing operations (insert, modify, remove) in
    the randomized usage scenario, as expected.

    \item Rollback suffers from memory limits in the sequential usage scenario.

    \item It actually does not pay off to reorder operations or eliminate
    superfluous ones.

  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
